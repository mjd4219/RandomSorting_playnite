# RandomSorting_playnite
Playnite plugin to allow lists to be sorted in a random order. 

It works by generating a random number for each non-hidden game in your library, and assigning this number as either a Category or a Tag (uses Categories by default). You can then order your list by Category (or by Tag, depending on your configuration), and the list will be sorted in a random order. The plugin can be configured to run each time playnite starts, and/or each time a game is started.  

Warning: this plugin generates an individual Category or Tag for each game in your library, which can make it difficult to browse your existing Tags or Categories. To clean up any Tags or Categories created by the plugin, disable the plugin and use Library Manager.
