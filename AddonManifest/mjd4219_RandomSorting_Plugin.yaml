ShortDescription: Generates random identifiers to allow game lists to be sorted randomly. 
Description: RandomSorting plugin is a work-around to allow game lists to be sorted randomly. The idea is that your lists will feel fresh each time you view the library. It works by generating a random number for each non-hidden game in your library, and assigning this number as either a Category or a Tag. By default, the number is prefixed with '[Random] '. You can then order your list by Category (or by Tag, depending on your configuration), and the list will be sorted in the random order. The plugin can be configured to run each time playnite starts, and/or each time a game is started.
